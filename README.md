# Command line blackjack game

<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This is a command line blackjack game written in Typescript and powered by Node js. The intent of this project was to strengthen my understanding of the core JS fundamentals and working with more complex logic. It was also an opportunity to work within the node ecosystem and refine my Typescript skills. The game closely resembles a real Blackjack game with multiple players and all the same rules and procedures except that I did not add in card suits. 

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/> 
--Javascript<br/>
--Node.js<br/>
--TypeScript<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/> 
The biggest takeaways were getting a chance to build something in Node and Typescript. This was the first project I applied these and was a good learning opportunity. The biggest challenge of this app was creating the deck. The deck is generated based on the amount of players at the table and the cards are decremented on each draw. In addition, the deck shuffles when 50% of the cards have been used. The cards are determined by a random number and it was a challenge ensuring that a specific card doesn't get drawn if they no longer remain in the deck.

<b>Current status:</b><br/> 
The project is finished, but I am currently rebuilding in React for some practice. This will be fully functioning with suits and everthing. It may even have a UI.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
There is no user interface so this app has to be run through the computer's command line and requires node js and typescript to be installed.
