# blackjack

This is a command line blackjack app written in Typescript and powered by Node js. The intent of this project was to strengthen my understanding of the core computer science fundamentals like working with conditionals, arrays, objects, storing and passing around data, debugging etc.. It was also an opportunity to work within the node ecosystem and learn/apply typescript. 

Note:
There is no user interface so this app has to be run through the command line and requires node js and typescript to be installed. 

How to play:
Load app and navigate into the dist directory and type node index to run app.
