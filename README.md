# blackjack

This is a command line blackjack game written in Typescript and powered by Node js. The intent of this project was to strengthen my understanding of the core fundamentals like working with conditionals, arrays, objects, storing and passing around data, debugging etc. It was also an opportunity to work within the node ecosystem and refine my Typescript skills.

Note:

There is no user interface so this app has to be run through the computer's command line and requires node js and typescript to be installed. 

How to play:

Download app and install in a location of your choosing, open the Blackjack-main folder, click on the dist folder and locate the file titled index.js., open the command line on your computer (Terminal on Mac - Command Prompt on Windows), in the command line: type node then drag the index.js file and drop into the command line (this contains the absolute file path)

It should look something like this: 

yourname@yourname-MacBook-Air ~ % node /Users/yourname/Desktop/blackjack-main/dist/index.js 

Click enter to begin the game and follow instructions.

Let me know if you encounter any bugs.
