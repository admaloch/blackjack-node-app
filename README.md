# Command line blackjack game

<b>About this Project:</b><br/>
This is a command-line blackjack game built in TypeScript and powered by Node.js. The primary aim was to enhance my grasp of core JavaScript fundamentals and delve into more intricate logic. Additionally, it provided an opportunity to immerse myself in the Node ecosystem and refine my TypeScript skills. The game faithfully mirrors a real Blackjack game, allowing multiple players and adhering to standard rules and proceduresâ€”minus the inclusion of card suits.

<b>Technologies Utilized:</b><br/>
- <b>Javascript</b><br/>
- <b>Node.js</b><br/>
- <b>TypeScript</b><br/>

<b>Key Takeaways:</b><br/>
This was my initial application of TypeScript and Node, so it was a valuable learning experience. The most significant challenge was the creation of the deck. The deck dynamically generates based on the number of players at the table, and cards are decremented with each draw. Additionally, the deck undergoes shuffling when 50% of the cards have been used. Managing the randomness to ensure that specific cards aren't drawn if they're no longer in the deck was a challenge.

<b>Current Status:</b><br/>
The project is finished, but I am currently rebuilding in React for some practice. This will be fully functioning with suits and everything. It may even have a UI.


<b>Note:</b><br/>
This application lacks a user interface and necessitates execution through the computer's command line. Node.js and TypeScript need to be installed to run it.
