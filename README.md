# Command line blackjack game

<h2>About</h2>
<p> This is a command-line blackjack game built with TypeScript and powered by Node.js. The primary aim was to enhance
my grasp of core JavaScript fundamentals and delve into more intricate logic. Additionally, it provided an
opportunity to immerse myself in the Node ecosystem and refine my TypeScript skills. The game faithfully mirrors
a real Blackjack game, allowing multiple players and adhering to standard rules and proceduresâ€”minus the
inclusion of card suits.

<h2>Technologies used:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Javascript</li>
<li> Node.js</li>
<li> TypeScript</li>
</ul>


<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
<p> This was my initial application of TypeScript and Node, so it was a valuable learning experience. The most
significant challenge was the creation of the deck. The deck dynamically generates based on the number of
players at the table, and cards are decremented with each draw. Additionally, the deck undergoes shuffling when
50% of the cards have been used. Managing the randomness to ensure that specific cards aren't drawn if they're
no longer in the deck was a challenge.
</p>

<h2>Current Status:</h2>
<p>    The project is finished, but I am building a new version in <a
href="https://github.com/admaloch/react-blackjack">React</a>, complete with a UI and Firebase backend.</p>
